AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypoxia presents a salient feature investigated in most solid tumors 
      that holds key roles in cancer progression, including glioblastoma multiforme 
      (GBM). Here, we aimed to construct a hypoxia-derived gene signature for 
      identifying the high-risk GBM patients to guide adjuvant therapy and precision 
      nursing based on signs of hypoxia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the 
      transcriptome profiling and clinicopathological characteristics of GBM from The 
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) cohorts. A 
      series of bioinformatic and machine learning methods were comprehensively applied 
      for establishing a hypoxia-derived gene signature in prediction of overall 
      survival, disease-free survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free 
      survival. The predictive efficacy of this model was assessed with receiver 
      operator characteristic (ROC) and uni- and multivariate cox regression analysis. 
      The associations of this signature with tumor microenvironment and 
      immunotherapeutic response predictors were evaluated across GBM. RT-qPCR and 
      western blotting were presented for validating the expression of ALDH3B1 and CTSZ 
      in human glioma cell lines (U251, SHG-44, and U87) and normal glial cell line 
      HEB. RESULTS: Among hallmarks of cancer, hypoxia acted as a prominent risk factor 
      of GBM prognosis. A hypoxia-derived gene signature displayed efficient ability in 
      predicting clinical outcomes. High risk score indicated undesirable prognosis, 
      recurrence, and progression of GBM. Moreover, this risk score displayed positive 
      correlations to immunity and stromal activation. Combining immunotherapeutic 
      response predictors, high-risk patients more benefited from immunotherapy. 
      ALDH3B1 and CTSZ expression had prominent upregulation in glioma cells than 
      normal glial cells. CONCLUSION: Collectively, this hypoxia-derived gene signature 
      could become a reliable biomarker for predicting prognosis and therapeutic 
      response and providing theoretical support for hypoxia treatment and precision 
      nursing of GBM patients.
