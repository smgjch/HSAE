AB  - Due to the lack of a suitable gene signature, it is difficult to assess the 
      hypoxic exposure of HCC tissues. The clinical value of assessing hypoxia in HCC 
      is short of tissue-level evidence. We tried to establish a robust and 
      HCC-suitable hypoxia signature using microarray analysis and a robust rank 
      aggregation algorithm. Based on the hypoxia signature, we obtained a 
      hypoxia-associated HCC subtypes system using unsupervised hierarchical clustering 
      and a hypoxia score system was provided using gene set variation analysis. A 
      novel signature containing 21 stable hypoxia-related genes was constructed to 
      effectively indicate the exposure of hypoxia in HCC tissues. The signature was 
      validated by qRT-PCR and compared with other published hypoxia signatures in 
      multiple large-size HCC cohorts. The subtype of HCC derived from this signature 
      had different prognosis and other clinical characteristics. The hypoxia score 
      obtained from the signature could be used to indicate clinical characteristics 
      and predict prognoses of HCC patients. Moreover, we reveal a landscape of immune 
      microenvironments in patients with different hypoxia score. In conclusion, we 
      identified a novel HCC-suitable 21-gene hypoxia signature that could be used to 
      estimate the hypoxia exposure in HCC tissues and indicated prognosis and a series 
      of important clinical features in HCCs. It may enable the development of 
      personalized counselling or treatment strategies for HCC patients with different 
      levels of hypoxia exposure.
