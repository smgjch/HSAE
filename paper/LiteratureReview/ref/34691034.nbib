AB  - We aim to construct a hypoxia- and immune-associated risk score model to predict 
      the prognosis of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By 
      unsupervised consensus clustering algorithms, we generate two different hypoxia 
      clusters. Then, we screened out 682 hypoxia-associated and 528 immune-associated 
      PDAC differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of PDAC using Pearson correlation 
      analysis based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression 
      project (GTEx) dataset. Seven hypoxia and immune-associated signature genes 
      (S100A16, PPP3CA, SEMA3C, PLAU, IL18, GDF11, and NR0B1) were identified to 
      construct a risk score model using the Univariate Cox regression and the Least 
      Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox regression, which 
      stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups and were further validated in 
      the GEO and ICGC cohort. Patients in the low-risk group showed superior overall 
      survival (OS) to their high-risk counterparts (p < 0.05). Moreover, it was 
      suggested by multivariate Cox regression that our constructed hypoxia-associated 
      and immune-associated prognosis signature might be used as the independent factor 
      for prognosis prediction (p < 0.001). By CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE algorithms, we 
      discovered that patients in high-risk groups had lower immune score, stromal 
      score, and immune checkpoint expression such as PD-L1, and different immunocyte 
      infiltration states compared with those low-risk patients. The mutation spectrum 
      also differs between high- and low-risk groups. To sum up, our hypoxia- and 
      immune-associated prognostic signature can be used as an approach to stratify the 
      risk of PDAC.
