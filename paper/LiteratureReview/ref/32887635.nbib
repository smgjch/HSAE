AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoxia plays an indispensable role in the development of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there are few studies on the application 
      of hypoxia molecules in the prognosis predicting of HCC. We aim to identify the 
      hypoxia-related genes in HCC and construct reliable models for diagnosis, 
      prognosis and recurrence of HCC patients as well as exploring the potential 
      mechanism. METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis was performed 
      using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database 
      and four clusters were determined by a consistent clustering analysis. Three DEGs 
      closely related to overall survival (OS) were identified using Cox regression and 
      LASSO analysis. Then the hypoxia-related signature was developed and validated in 
      TCGA and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database. The Gene Set 
      Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore signaling pathways regulated 
      by the signature. CIBERSORT was used for estimating the fractions of immune cell 
      types. RESULTS: A total of 397 hypoxia-related DEGs in HCC were detected and 
      three genes (PDSS1, CDCA8 and SLC7A11) among them were selected to construct a 
      prognosis, recurrence and diagnosis model. Then patients were divided into high- 
      and low-risk groups. Our hypoxia-related signature was significantly associated 
      withÂ worse prognosis and higher recurrence rate. The diagnostic model also 
      accurately distinguished HCC from normal samples and nodules. Furthermore, the 
      hypoxia-related signature could positively regulate immune response. Meanwhile, 
      the high-risk group had higher fractions of macrophages, B memory cells and 
      follicle-helper T cells, and exhibited higher expression of immunocheckpoints 
      such as PD1and PDL1. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our study showed that 
      hypoxia-related signature is a potential biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis and 
      recurrence of HCC, and it provided an immunological perspective for developing 
      personalized therapies.
